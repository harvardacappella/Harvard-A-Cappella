		<p>Dear Harvard College Students,<p>

		<p class="indent">On behalf of the entire Harvard a cappella community, we hope that you are all staying safe and preparing for an undoubtedly unusual but exciting school year. A cappella music has been a huge part of our undergraduate experience, and we cannot wait to continue singing with you this fall. Each a cappella group at Harvard has its own distinct musical style, culture, and history. Regardless of the group you join, we are confident that you will make lasting memories and forge powerful musical connections. Although the restrictions imposed by the pandemic will preclude many of these groups from conducting auditions this fall, we are all committed to finding creative ways to welcome you to our vibrant community. <p>

		<p class="indent">Over the course of the year, all of Harvard’s a cappella groups will work together to organize events, spanning from virtual recordings to informal social mixers. We hope to give you a taste of Harvard a cappella while supporting you on your own artistic journey. If you are interested in singing with us this year, please sign up for our email list and follow our social media at http://bit.ly/harvardacappella/. Feel free to DM us with any questions! You can also check out each group’s website and social media channels to see group-specific plans for the fall. We look forward to getting to know you more over the coming months and wish you well as you begin the school year. </p>


		<p>Best Regards,</p>
		<p>Harvard College A Cappella</p>
